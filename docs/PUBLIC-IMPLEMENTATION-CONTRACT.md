# Public implementation contract

This document defines durable public behavior for the current application. Detailed legacy observations used for cutover comparison live separately in [LEGACY-PUBLIC-CONTRACT.md](LEGACY-PUBLIC-CONTRACT.md).

## Canonical route model

Public routing is driven by persisted typed Site Nodes rather than hard-coded legacy page/category names.

| Surface | Canonical path | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | `/` | Singleton Home presentation. |
| Gallery | `/{section-slug}` | Published Gallery Site Node backed by Gallery persistence. |
| Journal | `/{section-slug}` | Published active Blog or Exhibitions Journal. |
| Journal entry | `/{section-slug}/{entry-slug}` | Public entry belonging to matching active Journal. |
| Custom Page | `/{section-slug}` | Published structured Custom Page. |
| Artwork detail | `/artworks/{slug}` | Stable shareable Artwork view. |
| Navigation Node | none | Structural navigation only. |

Protected preview equivalents live below `/preview` and do not make draft/private content publicly discoverable.

Protected media equivalents live below `/preview/media/...`; authenticated preview may render unavailable-to-public assets without changing ordinary public-media eligibility.

## Publication and discoverability

Only publicly eligible content appears in public rendering/navigation/sitemap/viewer sequences.

- Home is public according to its active presentation/gate behavior;
- Gallery/Journal/Custom availability follows Site Node publication state;
- Navigation Nodes have no content page;
- Journal entries satisfy active template + lifecycle requirements;
- draft/private content is only available through authenticated preview/admin boundaries;
- unknown/malformed routes fail safely.

A canonical media **reference** does not automatically mean the asset is publicly deliverable.

## Site navigation

Navigation is generated from canonical Site Node tree and persisted order/visibility, not hard-coded page arrays/legacy category assumptions.

The public visual composition remains artist-specific rather than adopting a generic CMS theme.

## Home presentation

Home supports four presentation modes:

- **Artwork** — deterministic hero Artwork from eligible public Gallery/Artwork sources;
- **Under Construction** — explicit gated structured component presentation;
- **Skip Home** — redirect/fallback behavior to an eligible target;
- **Custom** — ordered structured Home components.

Artwork selection uses canonical Gallery eligibility, Artwork date and explicit tie-break semantics. Ambiguous invalid state is surfaced rather than resolved by incidental DB order.

Home direct/Rich Text media use the same canonical MediaAsset/public/preview contracts as other consumers.

## Gallery and Artwork ordering

Gallery presentation uses persisted Artwork `position` as authoritative order.

- deliberate reorder persists;
- IDs/timestamps/database order are not runtime fallbacks;
- moving Artwork preserves canonical media relations;
- unassigned Artwork is not part of public Gallery sequence;
- published Artwork cannot remain public through invalid/missing/unpublished Gallery relation.

Viewer previous/next follows the same public Gallery order.

## Artwork presentation/media/viewer

Public Artwork exposes approved authored metadata and valid media.

Canonical originals remain authoritative; missing/corrupt/unavailable required media is readiness/integrity failure, not permission to choose unrelated fallback.

Informative public images require canonical ALT; explicit Artwork usage override takes precedence only where that consumer supports it.

Gallery Artwork primary media may be image or supported video. Video uses manual/native controls/no autoplay and shares close/sequence context without image-specific zoom/pan.

The image viewer supports close/Escape, visible zoom, wheel/trackpad zoom, touch pinch/pan where supported, pointer pan when enlarged, previous/next with boundaries, viewport recalculation, loading/error state and correct accessibility/focus behavior.

## Rich Text public rendering

Canonical Rich Text public rendering uses Markdown through `SafeRichTextRenderer`.

Embedded Media Files images use canonical `media:<id>` references resolved by central media rendering. Arbitrary external-image URLs and legacy Journal inline-token runtime syntax are not equivalent public formats.

## Custom Pages, CV and Contact

Custom Pages are ordered structured components validated by `CustomPageSetting`. CV/Vita is represented through Custom Page/CV composition rather than a special runtime node type.

Contact is a reusable Custom Page component, not a standalone runtime page type.

Public Contact workflow validates server-side, enforces honeypot/rate-limit controls, delivers to configured private recipient, uses visitor email as Reply-To rather than forged From, exposes safe outcome and fails in controlled fashion when delivery unavailable.

General owns public email/visibility, social links, favicon, private Contact recipient and truly global legal/public text. SMTP/DKIM/TLS remain runtime/platform secrets.

## Journals

### Template switching

Blog and Exhibitions are separate content products sharing Journal placement/settings mechanics.

Switching the active Journal template does not convert/delete retained inactive rows. Public rendering exposes only the active template's eligible content; retained inactive content remains canonical editorial/reference data and can reappear when switched back.

### Blog

A Blog Journal lists only public Posts belonging to it and satisfying lifecycle/schedule. Body uses canonical Rich Text Markdown/media references. Structured Cover/Gallery media use canonical Journal media policy.

### Exhibitions

An Exhibitions Journal lists public Exhibitions belonging to it.

Canonical editorial/public concepts include title, dates, vernissage/opening, venue/venue website, separate Street/City/Country, rich description, external link, optional Gallery and optional Map.

Street is stored/displayed separately from city/country; public address composition avoids duplication.

#### Gallery

Gallery is an explicit per-Exhibition presentation feature.

- `gallery_enabled=true` permits ordered structured Gallery usages to render publicly subject to normal entry/node/media readiness;
- `gallery_enabled=false` hides Gallery presentation without deleting usages;
- disabled Gallery assets remain referenced but are not publicly deliverable merely because the Exhibition is published;
- Cover publication is independent of Gallery enabled state.

#### Map

Map is an explicit per-Exhibition presentation feature.

- `map_enabled=true` requires valid geodata;
- public Map visibility is not inferred merely from coordinates or timing;
- current presentation shapes are `wide` and `square`;
- `ExhibitionMapPresentation` owns canonical map source/presentation data;
- public attachment below the Exhibition and editor preview should consume the same presentation contract;
- a future Rich Text map embed must reuse that renderer/contract rather than create a second mapping technology.

## Public media delivery

Only media valid for the requesting public consumer is exposed.

- private/quarantined/deleted originals are not public substitutes;
- required variants must exist where required;
- public routes do not expose arbitrary storage paths;
- references remain authoritative when content moves/detaches/disables presentation/deletes;
- being accepted into Files does not imply universal public-consumer support;
- protected preview routes do not weaken ordinary public eligibility.

Structured Journal Cover/Gallery runtime ALT uses canonical MediaAsset ALT. Legacy Journal usage overrides are not runtime public authority.

See [MEDIA.md](MEDIA.md).

## SEO and metadata

- indexable pages have canonical HTTPS URLs;
- sitemap follows current public model and excludes admin/preview/drafts/navigation-only nodes;
- `robots.txt` does not advertise private/admin/preview content;
- stable Artwork/content slugs support sharing;
- deliberate path changes may create redirect records;
- titles/favicon/meaningful ALT remain part of acceptance.

## Analytics boundary

Public Matomo tracking is optional runtime config. Analytics failure does not block rendering/navigation/viewer/Contact.

No form content, visitor email/name, admin IDs or secret values are emitted as analytics payload. See [ANALYTICS.md](ANALYTICS.md).

## Responsive/artistic presentation

The public site preserves Lars Möller's established visual identity: artwork-first presentation, typography, spacing and restrained header/navigation/content treatment.

Reliability/accessibility/responsive improvements are allowed but must not silently replace artistic composition with generic portfolio/card templates.

## Deliberately not preserved

The target does not preserve insecure HTTP behavior, blanket legacy query dispatch, legacy admin/auth/session/SQL/upload implementation, warning/debug output, broken handlers, accidental DB order, public workshop/development surfaces, unsafe Rich Text or missing-media fallbacks that hide integrity problems.

## Acceptance

Public acceptance requires durable publication/routing/data verification, media integrity, viewer interaction checks, isolated Validation, representative browser comparison and explicit editorial/artist review before Production cutover.
